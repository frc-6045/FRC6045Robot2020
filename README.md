# Team 6045 - Sabre Robotics
## FIRST Robotics Competition 3rd Year Team
## Infinite Recharge Robot
## Name: Roll
## Motto: “We are on the rise!”

Welcome to the Sabre Robotics FIRST Team’s github page. This year our robot’s name is the Roll, continuing on the bread themed naming process from last year. We are choosing to put our robot’s code on github in order to make inhouse programming sharing easier and make it a potential resource for the community. 

Feel free to browse our code if you are curious to see how we designed it, or if you are looking for a example for a specific system. All we ask is that you don’t directly copy and paste and that you give credit were credit is due. At the end of the Read Me you will find links to form posts and documentation that helped us create the code for the Roll.
